Please [install git scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and if you would like
to use a graphical interface, we recommend [sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).

To interact with the [DIAG organisation on github](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen) 
please create a github account, and then email your username to
one of the members of the RSE team.

We'll do our work in the `Desktop` folder so make sure you change your working directory to it with:

~~~
$ cd
$ cd Desktop
~~~
{: .bash}
