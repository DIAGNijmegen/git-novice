If you only have the free version of github you're limited to
doing all of your work publically.
Whilst we support open science, the prefered way to work is to 
keep everything private by default, and then open source things on 
a case by case basis. The DIAGNijmegen github is where we should do any
new work.

Information about [the diag organisation](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen)
can be found on [trac](https://repos.diagnijmegen.nl/trac/wiki/Github).
